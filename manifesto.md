## Manifesto Canvas: Founding an Ecosystem for Wealth Transition

### Title (working)

**Founding an Ecosystem for Wealth Transition: A Manifesto**

------

### Introduction

Between now and 2048, an estimated **$124 trillion** in wealth will transition from current owners to heirs and charitable organizations. This historic shift—often called the "Great Wealth Transfer"—presents a rare opportunity to reimagine how families navigate legacy, responsibility, and meaning.

Yet despite its scale, the current system for managing wealth transitions remains fragmented, overly technical, and ill-equipped to address the full human complexity of these changes.

This manifesto is a call to illuminate these complexities and to pioneer a new, integrative environment—one where professionals and families alike can find clarity, support, and a shared path forward.

We envision a system where collaboration replaces competition, integration replaces fragmentation, and where both families and professionals thrive within a generative, learning-focused ecosystem.

### Core Principles

#### 1. *Illuminating Complexity*

> "Turn on the lights in the cave."

Clarity emerges from collaboration. By fostering interdisciplinary teamwork, we aim to bring transparency and understanding to the most challenging aspects of wealth transitions.

#### 2. *Empowerment Through Environment*

> Like the Wright brothers, we prioritize creating an environment where flight is possible.

Rather than providing a one-size-fits-all answer, we cultivate the conditions in which families and professionals can discover their own meaningful paths.

#### 3. *Cadres, Not Silos*

> Cadres support each other across disciplines and serve families better than isolated experts ever could.

We believe in forming resilient, interconnected groups of professionals who learn and grow together—and who in turn empower families to do the same.

#### 4. *A Developmental Frame*

> Families aren’t problems to be solved—they are systems to be nurtured.

We support discovery over prescription. Families and advisors alike benefit most when engaged in ongoing, values-driven learning together.
