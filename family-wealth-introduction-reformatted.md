# INTRODUCTION  

Thank you for honoring me by opening this book and taking the journey it offers. To begin a journey is an act of courage. I hope your courage will be rewarded by new ideas and practices that will enable your family to preserve its wealth long into the future.  

To those of you (pilgrims on the road to Compostella) who read the first edition of *Family Wealth: Keeping It in the Family*, welcome back to the journey seven years later. I hope your journey so far has been rewarding and that your family governance systems are functioning well. I also hope you will find the ideas on elders, ritual, practices, evaluation of the third generation, mentorship, and the role of the *homme d’affaires*, newly included in this revised edition, a way to see what I have learned since we parted.  

To all who are journeying with me, let me paraphrase what Chaucer says at the beginning of *The Canterbury Tales*: as we are all pilgrims journeying to Canterbury individually, why not walk together and tell each other our stories? This is my story of family, and I welcome your stories as they join mine.

Thirteen years ago, I found myself professionally in the same “dark wood” described by Dante in the introduction to *The Inferno*.  

- For the prior twenty-three years I had been honored by the decisions of many families to use my professional skills as an attorney.  
- Most of these families sincerely believed that I helped them, and for many of those early years, I thought so, too.  
- Gradually, however, I came to realize that while I was solving the problems they brought to me, most of these families were not successfully preserving their wealth when measured against the proverb we in America describe as “Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.”  

I realized that the skills I had—and, more important, my thought process in applying those skills—did not offer any solution to the proverb, or to my fundamental professional responsibility to these families.  

As this reality deepened its hold on me, I found myself in the “dark wood” wondering how, or even if, I should continue the active practice of law. Even more profoundly, I feared that I might be violating the most fundamental credo of any professional: *Do no harm*.  

---

After a period of retreat and reflection, I decided to begin exploring whether there was a way of thinking about the long-term preservation of a family’s wealth, and whether there were practices a family could employ to overcome the effects of the proverb.  

I hoped that through this exploration I could continue to practice law using these new ways of thinking and skills to respond effectively—first to the negative presumption of the proverb (that long-term wealth preservation by a family is impossible), and second to my individual concern that I should do no harm.  

This book is my effort to share with you what I have discovered so far.

To begin our process of discovery together, let me share some insights about myself so you know who you are journeying with and why I am so curious about this subject:  

1. **Maternal family history**  
   - My great-grandfather, a German immigrant, arrived in the United States during the Civil War.  
   - He enlisted as a “bounty soldier,” risking his life in exchange for money that would allow him to start a business.  
   - Happily, he survived and eventually created a substantial fortune — the prototypical first-generation creator of wealth.  
   - My grandfather, the ninth of eleven children, later lost his portion of the family wealth through poor investments and bankruptcy.  
   - Thus, in my mother’s family, wealth was lost by the second generation rather than the third. This family history, particularly the pain of seeing my grandfather—my first best friend—struggle, has haunted me and shaped my calling to this work.  

2. **Paternal family history**  
   - I am the sixth generation in my family to practice law.  
   - My forebears were justices of the peace, judges, lawyers, and managing partners in respected firms.  
   - This tradition has instilled in me a strict sense of responsibility to be just, to serve my clients’ interests fully, and to treat law as both a personal calling and a family responsibility.  

3. **Learning and practice**  
   - I believe we learn in two fundamental ways: through study or through practice.  
   - Personally, I learn best through intensive study, so I must work harder to learn through practice.  
   - When I was in the “dark wood,” I set myself two tasks:  
     - **Study**: read everything possible about families, their relationships, and the spiritual foundations of those relationships.  
     - **Practice**: ask families directly how they lived and practiced these relationships.  
   - In 2000, I helped found what is now the **Family Capital Institute**, dedicated to helping families learn together, each in the way they learn best.

The results of my study and practice are reflected in the structure of this book:  

- **Chapter 1** describes my philosophy:  
  - A family can successfully preserve its greatest wealth — its human beings — over time.  
  - Family wealth consists primarily of human and intellectual capital, secondarily of financial capital.  
  - The purpose of a family is to enhance each member’s pursuit of happiness in the context of preserving the family as a whole.  
  - Long-term preservation requires governance: systems for joint decision-making that produce more positive than negative outcomes over at least a century.  

- **Chapters 2–8**: practices for defining mission, measuring success, investing together, enhancing financial skills, leveraging strengths, and working effectively with advisers.  

- **Chapters 9–15**: frameworks for responsibility, beneficiary–trustee relationships, philanthropy, peer review, and private trust companies.  

- **Chapters 16–21**: reflections on the roles of family members, mentors, trustees, and the concept of a perpetual trust.

This book does not contain a separate chapter on spirituality, though I am convinced it is the foundation of all successful family wealth preservation.  

Families who succeed reflect five virtues:  

- Truth  
- Beauty  
- Goodness  
- Community  
- Compassion  

And above all, *Love*.  

Without this spiritual component, no family can succeed in preserving its wealth or itself.  

If your family has not yet appreciated and incorporated these values into its ethic, then begin there. Only then will the ideas in this book make sense.

I hope that whether you learn best through study (Chapters 1 and 16–21) or through practice (Chapters 2–15), you will find at least one suggestion that gives you the courage to believe the proverb can be overcome.  

I believe it can.
